# To-Do List App
This project is a task listing application implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API for the back-end services, a local SQL database, and Angular 12 framework for the front-end/UI component.
The application contains a set of features which include: 

- Fetching all To-Do List items saved in the DB
- Fetching a single To-Do List item saved in the DB
- Updating a To-Do List item record saved in the DB
- Marking a To-Do List item as complete 
- Deleting a To-Do List item from the DB


The To-Do List application, although contained in one GitHub repository, technically comprises of two projects; one for the ASP.NET Core back-end architecture which provides the Web API services, and another for the Angular framework application user interface which supports and enriches user interactions by making http requests through the services.
